Revision history for perl module Text::Amuse::Compile

0.32 2015-02-03

 - Support for #hyphenation tag in the header. Dependency of
   Text::Amuse bumped because of needed hyphenation method.

0.31 2015-01-19

 - New option: opening (for chapter pages)
 - Interpret (via Text::Amuse) and so escape all the strings passed
   to the templates

0.30 2015-01-18

 - Downgraded requirement from Template to Template::Tiny. This change
   should produce a minor performance improvement (both speed and
   memory-wise) and, more important, pull out the complicated logic
   from the the LaTeX template into the code. This of course will
   prevent to do crazy stuff into the template. I see this as a
   feature. Eventually, if the need arise, there could be an option to
   use Template instead, given that the interface is the same. This is
   a major clenaup which has the potential to introduce bugs.

 - Added validation for extra values

0.27 2015-01-13

 - Fixed minor bug with missing cleardoublepage after title page
 - Prepared tests for upcoming downgrade from Template to Template::Tiny

0.26 2014-12-12

 - Fixed bug with missing escape in the epub's titlepage

0.25 2014-10-10

0.24 2014-09-08

 - LaTeX template change: reduced the footskip to 2 baselines.

0.23 2014-09-02

 - No code change. More verbose output in the methods.t which had a
   bunch of unexplicable test failing on windows.

0.22 2014-08-30

 - Added notoc option to suppress the table of content generation

0.21 2014-08-08

 - Changed default LaTeX class to book, even for texts without a table
   of contents. You can switch to the old behaviour either setting
   nocoverpage to a true value in the header or passing the extra key
   nocoverpage=1 to the compiler.
